PROBLEM URL: https://open.kattis.com/problems/digicomp2
TAGS: topological-sort
EXPLANATION: 
rather than simulating what would happen if we dropped
a marble one by one, we can instead create the graph 
described, perform a topological sort to determine switches
where all marbles present have have been accounted for, 
use the parity of the number of marbles to determine if the
state of the switch needs to be toggled, and then split the
marbles to its children depending on the original orientation 
of the switch. Additionally an initial search for switches 
with in-degree 0 other than the switch where marbles are 
initially dropped needs to be done in order to allow their 
children to be searched during the final topological sort.
